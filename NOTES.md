# Notes: decisions and measurements

Newest first within each milestone. Numbers are from the dev machine unless stated
(Apple M4 Pro, macOS 26.6) — the PRD's reference machine is an M1 MacBook Air.

## M0 — contracts (2026-09-25)

- **Frame v1 channels are planar** (mono, left, right) instead of interleaved, so every waveform
  view is zero-copy. Mono 6,496 B, stereo 10,592 B. See docs/protocols.md §1.
- **Shell and SDK are plain ES modules with JSDoc types**, type-checked by `tsc --checkJs`. The PRD
  asks for TypeScript built at build time *and* a checkout that runs with only uv; shipping source
  that needs no build satisfies both, with no committed build output to drift. Node is dev-only.
- **aiohttp serves HTTP and the WebSocket** on one event loop (the PRD allowed aiohttp for HTTP and
  named `websockets` for WS); one dependency instead of two.
- **Manifest `fallback`** is the `id` of another entry in the same manifest.
- **catap live check:** system capture delivers 48 kHz stereo float32, 512-frame buffers
  (~94 callbacks/s) with real signal from TIDAL — the hop matches catap's buffer size.
